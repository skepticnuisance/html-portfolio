<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi all! My name is Christopher and I'm starting up in Angela Yu's Web Dev course. Alittle bit about me:
  I graduated with a B.S. in engineering technology, and have gone down the routes of careers in software
  development and graphic design. I found through doing both that I might be better suited for a role where I
  can do both. I love the creative aspect of graphic design and the freedom of expression that comes with it, 
  however my brain is more naturally wired to work with analytics, which made software development an easy 
  route to go down for a time.</p>
<p>
  I took those two and figured and combination would be a fun thing to get into! So I'm a Web Developer now,
  and I've been looking to gain a better understanding behind the fundamentals of everything, so I figured I'd
  start from scratch. And man, so far it turns out that's been a good idea.
</p>

<p>There's a lot of little things here and there that are easy to miss when you jump right int things, so I'm
  glad to be taking this time for careful review. It's giving me the chance to learn all over again, and will
  better allow me to serve you, my client!
</p>

<p>I look forward to working with you in the future, thanks!</p>
