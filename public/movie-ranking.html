<h1>Chris's Top Choice Movies</h1>
<h2>I mean... you read the thing...</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Scott Pilgrim Vs The World</h3>
<p>
    A cult classic, one of those movies that I just love the 
    vibe of and could watch over and over.
</p>
<h3>Marriage Story</h3>
<p>
    A strong display of what felt like real intense emotions
    done really well between the two main actors. Powerful
    stuff.
</p>
<h3>Crazy Stupid Love</h3>
<p>
    Something about watching Ryan Gosling speak the most 
    fluent, seamless english I've ever seen is just too
    good, plus it's just a great time to haave Steve 
    Carell and Emma Stone
</p>
<h3>Now You See Me</h3>
<p>
    Magicians being magical is something I will seldom turn
    down. Watching Jesse Eisenberg be the ticking nerve
    speaker that he is and just the presense of anything 
    fatastical is always a plus to me.
